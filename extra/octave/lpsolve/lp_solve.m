#LP_SOLVE  Solves mixed integer linear programming problems.
#
#  SYNOPSIS: [obj,x,duals] = lp_solve(f,a,b,e,vlb,vub,xint,scalemode,keep)
#
#     solves the MILP problem
#
#             max v = f'*x
#               a*x <> b
#                 vlb <= x <= vub
#                 x(int) are integer
#
#  ARGUMENTS: The first four arguments are required:
#
#           f: n vector of coefficients for a linear objective function.
#           a: m by n matrix representing linear constraints.
#           b: m vector of right sides for the inequality constraints.
#           e: m vector that determines the sense of the inequalities:
#                     e(i) = -1  ==> Less Than
#                     e(i) =  0  ==> Equals
#                     e(i) =  1  ==> Greater Than
#         vlb: n vector of lower bounds. If empty or omitted,
#              then the lower bounds are set to zero.
#         vub: n vector of upper bounds. May be omitted or empty.
#        xint: vector of integer variables. May be omitted or empty.
#   scalemode: scale flag. Off when 0 or omitted.
#        keep: Flag for keeping the lp problem after it's been solved.
#              If omitted, the lp will be deleted when solved.
#
#  OUTPUT: A nonempty output is returned if a solution is found:
#
#         obj: Optimal value of the objective function.
#           x: Optimal value of the decision variables.
#       duals: solution of the dual problem.
